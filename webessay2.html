<h2 id="History">History</h2>
<p>Wolfgang Weingart is a Graphic Designer and Typographer born in German in 1941. In 1958 at the age of 17 he went to applied art and design in a 2-year program at the Merz Academy in Stuttgart, while there he discovered the schools printing facilities and at the age of 17 did his first hot metal type. He also learned other mediums of typesetting, linocut and woodblock printing. After successfully completing the 2-year program Wolfgang then completed a 3-year long apprenticeship in hot metal hand composition. It is here he met companies consulting designer, Karl-August Hanke, whom would become his mentor and encouraged Weingart to study in Switzerland. Karl-August Hanke was a past student of the Basel School of Design, and while mentoring Weingart, he introduced him to design outside of Germany more particularly in Switzerland. </p>

<p>Weingart met Emil Ruder and Armin Hofmann in Basel in 1963 thanks to Karl-August Hanke. And in the following year Weingart moved to Switzerland and enrolling in the Basel School of Design as an independent student. Later in 1968 Weingart was invited by Armin Hofmann to teach typography at the Schools newly established ‘Kunstgewerbeschule’ which where a type of vocational arts school that existed in German-speaking countries from the mid-19th century. Weingart would come to find himself in the company of designers who were not as focused on the Swiss-style principles in their work and these stylistic choices would ultimately greatly influence Weingart, who would become one of the first designers to abandon the strict principles that had influenced Swiss design for decades. And in 1974 at Armin Hofmann invitation again, Weingart would go to teach at the Yale summer program in Graphic Design in Brissago, Switzerland until 1996. For over forty years he has lectured and taught extensively in Europe, North and South America and the rest of the world.</p>

<h2 id="Weingart-Style">Weingart Style</h2>
<p>In his own words Wolfgang Weingart said; </p>
<blockquote>“I took 'Swiss Typography' as my starting point, but then I blew it apart, never forcing any style upon my students. I never intended to create a 'style'. It just happened that the students picked up—and misinterpreted—a so-called 'Weingart style' and spread it around.” – <cite>Wolfgang Weingart when interviewed by Yvonne Schwemer-Scheddin (1991)</cite></blockquote>

<p>Weingart had influenced a generation of typographers who exported his ideas to America and the world. This so-called style is sometimes referred to as the ‘Weingart Style’, 

Weingart is known to be a rebellious person when it comes to Designing. He has liked to push the limits on what would be considered the norm. From an early stage in his education he had broke the typographic rules swaying from the strict rules of the Swiss-style to being free with his spacing, and overall layout and organisation of the typesetting.
Weingart believed that the old Swiss-style was becoming stagnant, it was boring and anonymous. Thus, Weingart would set out to breathe new life in the world of teaching typography, a new typography. He believed that only way of breaking the rules that had held typographic was to know them well, this was an advantage he had learnt from his 3-years as an apprentice.
Weingart encouraged his students to think outside the box and experiment with their basic design relations such as size and weight, but he also encouraged them to experiment with the spacing between letters. The goal was to simple, to test the limits of readability. He allowed his students to have the freedom to experiment in ways to enhance and intensify their meanings and impact.

  Wolfgang Weingart is internationally recognised for his iconic work in the field of graphic design, Wolfgang has honed his craft when pushing the limits of typographic and to what is now referred to as the ‘New Wave’/’Swiss Punk’.  The biggest noticeable difference between Weingarts work and the New Wave from the old strict Swiss-style is the constant use of characteristics such as inconsistent letterspacing, varying type weights within in single words and the type set as varying angles.
